# Flight Deck — Architecture (as built)

This describes the code **as it exists today** (the walking skeleton). For the intended
full design and the reasoning, see the [design spec](superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-flight-deck-design.md).

## The spine

```
FlightDeckApp (@main SwiftUI App)
  └─ RootWindow (Scene / WindowGroup)
       └─ TerminalPane (NSViewRepresentable)
            ├─ owns/retains → GhosttyApp            (libghostty bring-up, hand-written)
            └─ hosts        → Ghostty.SurfaceView   (adapted Ghostty AppKit surface)
                                 └─ links → GhosttyKit.xcframework (libghostty C API)
```

- **`FlightDeckApp.swift`** — `@main`, just declares the scene.
- **`RootWindow.swift`** — a `Window` (not a `WindowGroup` — that would claim ⌘N) rendering `RootView`.
- **`TerminalPane.swift`** — the SwiftUI↔AppKit bridge. It hosts whichever surface `SessionStore` has selected: `updateNSView` detaches any surface that isn't the current selection (the Store keeps it retained, so its shell keeps running off-screen) and re-parents the selected one into a `TerminalHostView` rather than recreating it, so tab switching doesn't restart the shell. `TerminalHostView` is an `NSView` subclass that forwards frame changes to `Ghostty.SurfaceView.sizeDidChange(_:)`, which is what makes the terminal grid reflow on resize.
- **`ShellResolver.swift`** — pure helper: `SHELL` env → `/bin/zsh` fallback. TDD'd (`Tests/FlightDeckTests`).

## The reuse boundary: `Sources/FlightDeck/GhosttyEmbed/`

This directory is the crux of the "reuse Ghostty" approach. Ghostty's Swift `SurfaceView`
module could **not** be reused by reference — it hard-references app-shell types
(`AppDelegate`, `BaseTerminalController`, `TerminalWindow`, `SplitTree`, `SecureInputOverlay`,
`QuickTerminal`) that transitively pull in ~82 files (essentially all of Ghostty's macOS app).

So the surface was **adapt-copied**: copied into `GhosttyEmbed/` as **Flight-Deck-owned, editable**
files and decoupled from the app shell.

| Kind | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Adapted-copied, verbatim** | `SurfaceView_AppKit.swift` (2.2k lines), `Ghostty.Input.swift` (1.3k), `Ghostty.Surface.swift`, `Ghostty.Action.swift`, `Ghostty.Event.swift`, `Ghostty.Error.swift`, `Ghostty.Inspector.swift`, `Ghostty.Shell.swift`, `GhosttyPackage.swift`, `SecureInput.swift`, `NSEvent+Extension.swift`, `Helpers/**`, the `ObjCExceptionCatcher`/`VibrantLayer` ObjC pairs | Each carries `// Adapted from ghostty v1.3.1: <path>` (Ghostty is MIT). Byte-identical to vendor modulo the provenance header. **Treat as vendored-ish**: prefer re-pulling from upstream over hand-editing, except for deliberate decoupling. |
| **Adapted-copied, edited (decoupling)** | mostly `SurfaceView_AppKit.swift`; also `GhosttyPackage.swift` | Dropped: session-restoration/`Codable`, focus-follows-mouse, app-menu key forwarding, "Change Tab Title", `DerivedConfig` reduced to defaults, the `SplitTree` extension. `AppDelegate.logger` → `Ghostty.logger`. |
| **Hand-extracted** | `SurfaceConfiguration.swift` | `SurfaceConfiguration` / `SearchState` / `moveFocus` lifted out of Ghostty's dropped SwiftUI wrapper. |
| **Hand-written (Flight Deck's own)** | `GhosttyApp.swift` (~100 lines) | Replaces Ghostty's app-coupled 2.2k-line `Ghostty.App.swift`. Does only what the surface needs: `ghostty_init` (process-once), `ghostty_config_new`+load+finalize (guarded), `ghostty_app_new` with runtime callbacks, `tick()`, and a `makeSurfaceView` factory. `deinit` frees app+config. |

Net: **~97% of `GhosttyEmbed/` is reused Ghostty code**; the Flight-Deck-authored delta is the ~100-line wrapper plus the decoupling edits.

## Linkage & build config (`project.yml`, XcodeGen)

- **`GhosttyKit.xcframework`** (the built `libghostty`, a static-lib xcframework) is linked via `dependencies: [{ framework: vendor/ghostty-artifacts/GhosttyKit.xcframework, embed: false }]`. The reused Swift files `import GhosttyKit`. **Not** a raw `-lghostty` + header-search-path setup.
- **`SWIFT_VERSION: "5.0"`** (Swift 5 language mode under the Swift 6.3 compiler) — required so the vendored Ghostty code compiles without Swift-6 strict-concurrency breakage. Deliberate; see FOLLOWUPS.
- **`OTHER_LDFLAGS: -lstdc++`** — `libghostty` statically bundles C++ (glslang); matches Ghostty's own project.
- **`SWIFT_OBJC_BRIDGING_HEADER: Sources/FlightDeck/BridgingHeader.h`** — imports the two owned ObjC headers (`ObjCExceptionCatcher.h`, `VibrantLayer.h`), which transitively expose Foundation/QuartzCore target-wide (Ghostty relies on this implicit-Foundation trick). `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` points at `GhosttyEmbed/`.
- **Entitlements** (`FlightDeck.entitlements`) are the non-sandboxed subset (no `app-sandbox`, `disable-library-validation` on) — required to link a non-notarized static `libghostty`.
- The `.xcodeproj` is **generated** by XcodeGen from `project.yml` and is git-ignored.

## Runtime model

- **Tick loop:** `libghostty` only advances when `ghostty_app_tick` is called. `GhosttyApp`'s `wakeup` callback does `DispatchQueue.main.async { tick() }` (thread-safe), and `TerminalPane` kicks an initial tick so the first frame renders.
- **Retention:** one process-wide `GhosttyApp.shared`, held **weakly** by `SessionStore` (the store must not co-own a static that already owns itself for the life of the process). **This is the thing to change before multi-window/multi-session** — see the teardown-lifetime item in [FOLLOWUPS.md](FOLLOWUPS.md).
- **Shell launch:** the surface's PTY forks `ShellResolver.resolve()` in the working directory (verified: `FlightDeck → /usr/bin/login → -/bin/zsh`).
- **Surface sizing:** `TerminalPane`'s container is a `TerminalHostView`, an `NSView` subclass
  that forwards frame changes to `Ghostty.SurfaceView.sizeDidChange(_:)` — the call that
  reaches `ghostty_surface_set_size`. It exists because that method's upstream caller lives in
  the `SurfaceScrollView`/SwiftUI wrapper this app dropped during decoupling, so without the
  hook nothing calls it and the terminal never reflows. `updateNSView` reports the size on
  every update, not just on attach: re-parenting is how tab switching works, so a surface last
  shown at a different window size would otherwise carry a stale grid.

## Preferences

`Sources/FlightDeck/Preferences/` holds a pure core and a SwiftUI shell over it.

The core is a declarative `FlagSpec` catalog (`ClaudeFlagCatalog`, a snapshot of
`claude --help` at 2026-08-11) plus four pure functions: `ClaudeFlagQuoting` (tokenize /
quote), `ClaudeFlagParser` (text → `FlagSet` + diagnostics), `ClaudeFlagSerializer`
(`FlagSet` → text), and `FlagSetMerge` (project over global, per flag). The invariant
`parse(serialize(x)) == x` is what makes the two-way sync between the controls and the
command field safe; it is pinned in `ClaudeFlagSerializerTests`. Two details of that
invariant are load-bearing: `ClaudeFlagSerializer.serialize` emits the **passthrough run
first, then catalog order** — a list flag consumes every following non-flag token, so a
*trailing* passthrough run would get silently absorbed into it — and `ClaudeFlagQuoting`'s
tokens carry `wasQuoted`, with the parser refusing to read a quoted token as a flag. That is
what lets a value like `--verbose` on `--system-prompt` round-trip correctly; quoting alone
cannot fix it, because the parser never sees the quotes.

`PreferencesStore` (owned by `FlightDeckApp`, constructed **before** `SessionStore` because
that store restores inline) persists to `UserDefaults` behind `PreferencesPersisting`.
`SessionStore.insertSession` reads it once per session at creation: preferences configure
*new* sessions and never reconfigure a running one.

Project overrides are keyed by standardized path in `Preferences.projectFlags`, not held on
`Repo` — a `Repo` is removed when its last session closes, and an override must outlive that.

Unknown flags are preserved verbatim in `FlagSet.passthrough` and warned about rather than
rejected, so a `claude` release that adds a flag does not make the field lossy.

## Vendored layout (git-ignored build inputs/outputs)

- `vendor/ghostty` — submodule, pinned **v1.3.1** (`332b2ae`), pristine (never modified).
- `vendor/ghostty-artifacts/GhosttyKit.xcframework` — build output of `scripts/build-libghostty.sh`.
- `vendor/.zig-toolchain/` — Zig 0.15.2 (auto-downloaded by the build script).
- `vendor/.build-shim/` — the `xcrun` SDK shim (recreated by the build script).

## Session status pipeline

Sidebar rows show what each Claude session is doing. Two sources feed one map:

```
~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json ──> SessionStatusWatcher ──┐
  (Claude's own status registry,   (one per app, 500ms    │
   polled; see the design spec)     poll, keyed by         ├──> SessionStore.statuses
                                    sessionId)             │      [UUID: SessionStatus]
<transcript>.jsonl ──────────────> TranscriptWatcher ─────┘             │
  (outstanding Agent tool_use ids,  (one per session)                   v
   cleared at each turn boundary)                              SessionStatusIcon
                                                               SessionNotifier
```

- **`ClaudeStatusFile`** — pure decode of one registry file. Fails closed: an unknown
  `status`, a torn read, or a pid/filename mismatch all yield nil, and the watcher keeps
  its last known value. The registry is undocumented and unversioned, so this is the
  compatibility boundary.
- **`SessionStatusWatcher`** — polls rather than watching vnodes because `claude` rewrites
  the file in place with no create/rename, so a directory watch would never fire.
- **`SessionStore`** — merges registry activity with transcript-derived sub-agent counts,
  drops sessions Flight Deck does not own, and runs `SessionNotificationPolicy` on each
  transition.
- **`SessionNotifier`** — behind the `Notifying` protocol, because
  `UNUserNotificationCenter.current()` traps outside a signed bundle and would take the
  unit-test bundle down.

Full field shapes, the decompiled status derivation, and accepted limitations are in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-session-status-indicators-design.md`.

## Tab navigation

⌘⇧[ / ⌘⇧] move the selection along `repos.flatMap(\.sessions)` — the sidebar's visual order
flattened across project sections — wrapping at both ends. `SessionStore.selectNextSession()` /
`selectPreviousSession()` are the entry points; the wraparound algorithm lives in the private `cycleSelection(forward:)`. `TabNavigationCommands` supplies the Window-menu items.

The menu items are the *mechanism*, not decoration. AppKit gives the Ghostty surface's
`performKeyEquivalent` first refusal, and libghostty binds both shortcuts by default — but as
`consumed`-only bindings, which `MenuKeyEquivalents` routes to the main menu first. Before this
feature the keys were claimed by the surface and the resulting `previous_tab`/`next_tab` action
went nowhere.

## Not yet built (design, not code)

Harness adapters, the shared code index, the context engine, and the sidebar are **design only** so far — see the [spec](superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-flight-deck-design.md) §1–§9. Nothing in the current codebase implements them.
